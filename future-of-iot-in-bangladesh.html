        <p class="caption">Smart farming technologies could transform Bangladesh's agricultural landscape </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Introduction: The Dawn of a Smart Agricultural Revolution</h2>
    <p>In the heart of South Asia, Bangladesh stands at a technological crossroads. As the nation marches toward its vision of becoming a developed country by 2041, the Internet of Things (IoT) emerges as a transformative force with particular promise for the agricultural sector. With approximately <span class="highlight">47% of the workforce engaged in agriculture</span> and the sector contributing about 13% to the GDP, the potential impact of IoT implementation is enormous.</p>

    <p>The concept of IoT—a network of interconnected devices that collect, analyze, and act on data—has already begun reshaping industries worldwide. For Bangladesh, where agriculture remains both a cultural cornerstone and economic mainstay, smart farming technologies could address longstanding challenges of productivity, resource management, and climate resilience.</p>

    <div class="quote">
        "The integration of IoT in Bangladesh's agriculture isn't just about technological advancement—it's about food security, economic stability, and climate adaptation for millions of farmers." - Dr. Ayesha Chowdhury, Agricultural Technologist
